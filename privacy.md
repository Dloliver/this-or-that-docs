This Privacy Policy describes how the **This or That** Discord bot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, and protects information.

If you have questions, contact us here: **[Support](/support)**.

## Summary (plain English)
- The Bot is built to work **without needing personal data**.
- The Bot may process **Discord message content only when a command is invoked** (or when configured features require it), and only to respond in Discord.
- We do **not** sell personal data.
- If we ever add optional paid features, we’ll keep this policy updated and continue to minimize data collection.

## Who we are
- Bot name: **This or That**
- Owner/Developer: **Dendrxx Media / Do More Media Group LLC** (or your preferred legal entity name)
- Contact: **Put your support email here** (example: `support@yourdomain.com`)  
  *(You can also use a Discord support server invite on the Support page.)*

## Information the Bot may process
Depending on how your server uses the Bot, the Bot may process:

1. **Discord identifiers (required for functionality)**
   - Server (Guild) ID
   - Channel ID
   - User ID (only when needed to perform a user-requested action, such as attributing a response)

2. **Message content (event-based)**
   - The Bot may process the content of messages that invoke the Bot (e.g., slash commands, prefix commands, button interactions).
   - The Bot does not “read everything” for profiling; it only processes what it needs to respond to you.

3. **Configuration data (server settings)**
   - Settings you choose (e.g., which channel to post in, feature toggles, scheduling preferences).

4. **Diagnostic data**
   - Basic logs needed to keep the Bot stable (e.g., timestamps, error messages, command names).
   - Logs are used for troubleshooting and service integrity.

## What the Bot does NOT do
- Does not sell user data.
- Does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.
- Does not attempt to identify users outside of Discord.
- Does not use data for advertising profiles.

## How we use information
We use processed information to:
- Provide the Bot’s features (posting prompts, responding to commands, honoring server settings)
- Prevent abuse and keep the Bot stable (rate limiting, debugging, uptime monitoring)
- Improve features and fix bugs

## Data storage and retention
We aim to store as little as possible.

- **Server configuration data**: Stored as needed for the Bot to function and until removed by a server admin or until the Bot is removed from the server.
- **Logs/diagnostics**: Retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting and security.  
  Typical retention is limited (e.g., days to weeks), unless needed longer to investigate abuse or service failures.
- **Message content**: Not stored long-term by default. If a future feature requires storage (e.g., scheduled queues, analytics, premium preferences), this policy will be updated to reflect exactly what is stored and for how long.

## Legal bases (high-level)
We process data to:
- Perform the service you request (Bot commands/features)
- Maintain security and reliability (legitimate interests)
- Comply with legal obligations where applicable

## Sharing and disclosure
We may share data only in these limited cases:
- **Service providers** that help host the Bot (infrastructure/logging) solely to operate the service
- **Legal compliance** if required by law or valid legal process
- **Safety/security** if needed to protect users, servers, or the service from abuse

We do not share data for third-party marketing.

## Children’s privacy
Discord requires users to meet minimum age requirements. The Bot is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your choices and controls (Server Owners/Admins)
- Remove the Bot from your server to stop any future processing in that server.
- Adjust Bot permissions to limit where it can operate.
- Contact support to request deletion of stored configuration data associated with your server (see “Data Deletion Requests”).

## Data deletion requests
If you want data associated with your server removed:
- Contact us via **[Support](/support)** with:
  - Your **Server (Guild) ID**
  - A brief description of the request
- We may ask you to verify you’re a server admin/owner (to prevent unauthorized deletion requests).

## Security
We take reasonable steps to protect data (access controls, least-privilege principles, and secure hosting practices). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to minimize risk.

## International users
The Bot may be hosted in regions different from where you live. By using the Bot, you understand that processing may occur in those regions.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
