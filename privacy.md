## Information the Bot may process

### Discord identifiers
To operate correctly, the Bot may process:
- Server (Guild) ID
- Channel ID
- User ID (only when needed for a command or interaction)

### Message content
- The Bot processes message content **only when a user intentionally interacts with it** (such as commands, buttons, or scheduled posts).
- The Bot does not continuously monitor or profile conversations.

### Server configuration data
- Channel selections
- Schedule settings
- Feature toggles

---

## What the Bot does NOT do
- Does not sell or rent user data
- Does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information
- Does not track users across servers
- Does not perform advertising or behavioral profiling

---

## How information is used
Information is used only to:
- Provide bot functionality
- Maintain reliability and security
- Prevent abuse
- Improve features and fix bugs

---

## Data storage and retention
- **Configuration data** is stored while the Bot is active in a server.
- **Logs** are retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting and security.
- **Message content** is not stored long-term by default.

When the Bot is removed from a server, associated configuration data is deleted within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## Data sharing
We do not share data except:
- With infrastructure providers required to operate the service
- When legally required
- To protect users, servers, or the service from abuse

---

## Children’s privacy
The Bot is not intended for children and relies on Discord’s own age-restriction requirements.

---

## Your choices
Server owners can:
- Remove the Bot at any time
- Adjust permissions to limit access
- Request deletion of stored configuration data

---

## Data deletion requests
To request deletion of server-specific data, contact:
- **Email:** dendrxxcodes@gmail.com  
Include your **Server (Guild) ID** and confirmation that you are a server admin or owner.

---

## Security
Reasonable safeguards are used to protect data, though no system is 100% secure.

---

## Policy updates
This policy may be updated periodically. Changes will be reflected on this page.
