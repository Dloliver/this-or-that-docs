These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the **This or That** Discord bot (“the Bot”). By adding or using the Bot in a Discord server, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

## 1) Eligibility
You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, and you must have the authority to add/manage bots in the server where you use the Bot.

## 2) The service
The Bot provides conversation prompts and interactive features (e.g., “this or that” questions). The Bot is currently offered for free, but:
- We may introduce optional paid features in the future.
- We may modify or discontinue features at any time.

## 3) Acceptable use
You agree not to use the Bot to:
- Break any law or regulation
- Violate Discord’s Terms, Community Guidelines, or API/Developer policies
- Harass, abuse, or harm others
- Distribute malware, spam, or run scams
- Attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or disrupt the Bot or its infrastructure
- Use the Bot in ways that exceed reasonable rate limits or degrade service for others

We reserve the right to limit or block usage in cases of abuse.

## 4) Server owner/admin responsibilities
Server owners/admins are responsible for:
- Configuring channels/permissions appropriately
- Ensuring the Bot is used in compliance with server rules and Discord policies
- Only granting permissions the Bot truly needs

## 5) Data and privacy
Our data practices are described in the **[Privacy Policy](/privacy)**. By using the Bot, you acknowledge that the Bot may process limited Discord data necessary to provide functionality.

## 6) Availability and changes
We aim for a reliable experience, but the Bot is provided on an “as available” basis. We do not guarantee:
- Continuous uptime
- Error-free operation
- That features will remain unchanged

We may update the Bot at any time.

## 7) Third-party services
The Bot runs on third-party infrastructure (e.g., hosting providers). Your use may be subject to those providers’ terms as well.

## 8) Intellectual property
The Bot, its branding, and code are owned by the developer/owner (except where third-party libraries apply). You may not copy, resell, or distribute the Bot or its code without permission.

## 9) Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the Bot (in whole or in part) for any server or user if:
- These Terms are violated
- We reasonably believe misuse, abuse, or security threats exist
- Required by law or Discord policy

You can stop using the Bot at any time by removing it from your server.

## 10) Disclaimer
The Bot is provided “AS IS” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

## 11) Limitation of liability
To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or goodwill arising from your use of the Bot.

## 12) Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
